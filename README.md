# About the Data
The Data Contains 24960 images of both Cats and Dogs.

# About the Model
This Model differentiates whether an image is of a cat or dog using Convolutional Neural Networks. This model is ready to be used in IOT devices with the help of deepCC framework which converts this model in an executable file that can then be used in embedded devices such as Arduino, MCUs, etc. Here is one of the many ways to approach this problem.
